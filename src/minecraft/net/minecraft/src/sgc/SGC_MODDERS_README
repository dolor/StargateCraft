To add new mobs: ModLoader.addSpawn, passing in the biome you want it to spawn in.
To add a new dimension: create a WorldProviderSGCBase, create a WorldChunkManager for it and add BiomeGenBase(s) to that, 
    then add the class name of the worldProvider to mods/SGC/SGCTemplates.sgcp , in the array of 'worldProviders:'.
    
        BIOMEGENBASE SUBCLASSES
To add animals to a BiomeGen, call this in the constructor (example uses sheep):
        spawnableCreatureList.add(new SpawnListEntry(net.minecraft.src.EntitySheep.class, weight, minGroupCount, maxGroupCount));
Or, for monsters:
        spawnableMonsterList.add(new SpawnListEntry(net.minecraft.src.EntitySpider.class, weight, minGroupCount, maxGroupCount));
Water creatures:
        spawnableWaterCreatureList.add(new SpawnListEntry(net.minecraft.src.EntitySquid.class, weight, minGroupCount, maxGroupCount));
        
Trees, Plants, Ores etc. are generated by so-called BiomeDecorators. If you want to add another BiomeDecorator to do that job, override
this method in your BiomeGenBase subclass:
        protected BiomeDecorator createBiomeDecorator()
Returning a new instance of a BiomeDecorator subclass.

BiomeGenBases don't really generate themselves, everything is done by their BiomeDecorator.
